        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Back in 2020, the owner of Purrfectly Brewed had been busy at home baking pastries when they got the idea to open their own cafe. After the pandemic hit, Ash did all they could to scavenge for money from home so they could one day open the shop of their dreams. Entranced by the existence of cats, not only did they design the tiny Eugene cafe to be themed as such, but they even went the extra mile by teaming up with a local rescue shelter to help stray cats find their forever homes.</p></div>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Our mission at Purrfectly Brewed is to bring the community of cat lovers in Eugene together through every sip of coffee and every kitten we bring in.</p></div>
